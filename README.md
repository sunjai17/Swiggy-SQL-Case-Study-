# SQL Case Study: Analyzing Swiggy Data

## Overview
This repository contains a SQL case study where we analyze Swiggy-related data using SQL queries. The dataset consists of 8 CSV files containing information about delivery partners, food items, menus, order details, orders, restaurants, and users. Additionally, there's a notepad file containing specific questions to be answered using SQL queries.

## Dataset Description
- `delivery_partner.csv`: Information about delivery partners.
- `food.csv`: Details of food items offered by restaurants.
- `menu.csv`: Menu items offered by restaurants.
- `order_details.csv`: Details of individual orders placed.
- `orders.csv`: Information about orders placed by users.
- `restaurants.csv`: Details of restaurants.
- `users.csv`: Information about users.

## Notepad
The notepad file contains specific questions and tasks to be completed using SQL queries. Each question/task is designed to explore different aspects of the Swiggy data, ranging from basic querying to more complex analysis.

## Usage
To run the SQL queries and analyze the data:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Load the CSV files into your database or import them as tables.
4. Open your SQL client or command-line interface.
5. Execute the SQL queries provided in the `queries.sql` file to answer the questions and perform the analysis.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the CSV files with the Swiggy data.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries to answer the questions/tasks provided in the notepad.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## SQL Queries
The `queries.sql` file contains SQL queries to answer the questions/tasks provided in the notepad. You can execute these queries in your SQL client or command-line interface to analyze the Swiggy data.

## Note
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the SQL queries to gain deeper insights into the Swiggy data. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
